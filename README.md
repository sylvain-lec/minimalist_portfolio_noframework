A minimalist portfolio template done without any framework - only HTML, CSS & JavaScript
Feel free to modify it or add pages (keeping it free of frameworks) and submit your changes so that we can build a strong alternative to all the templates relying on frameworks, for those projects where one needs or wants to keep it simple.
